## Game plan ##
You (the TROLL) must avoid the cats which fly around the Arena, if they touch you you will lose the game. There are bonuses appearing at random which will be used as currency to unlock features of the game. The game will track statistics such as total number of seen enemies, total deaths, total game time and more. The game can be controlled with just a mouse, and support for the Xbox 360 Controller is planned.
